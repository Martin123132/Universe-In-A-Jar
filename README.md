Universe in a Jar is a groundbreaking simulation framework built on the Motion = Being Theory (MBT), a first-principles physics model that unifies cosmology, quantum behavior, and emergent complexity.


This project demonstrates how a universe can evolve from simple initial conditions, using nothing but MBT’s curvature-resistance geometry and motion-based principles—no dark matter, no exotic add‑ons, just raw dynamics.

What it does

Simulates spacetime expansion using MBT’s redshift model (the Daydream Curve).
Generates matter clustering and filamentary structures similar to the cosmic web.
Supports emergent complexity layers, enabling future extensions for stars, chemistry, and even symbolic agents.
Visualizes the evolving universe over time, creating a “universe in a jar” you can watch develop step by step.

Why it matters

Unified physics: Uses one consistent rule set across scales.
Educational tool: Allows students, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore cosmic evolution interactively.
Research potential: Raises questions about emergence, multiverse layering, and observational perspectives.

Who is involved

Martin Ollett – Founder, MBT architect, and lead researcher.
ChatGPT (OpenAI) – Co-developer (model design, documentation, and simulation logic).
GitHub Copilot – Assisted code co-developer (Python generation).

Future directions

GPU acceleration for larger-scale runs.
3D immersive projection (true “jar mode”).
Interactive symbolic agent layer for testing cultural and biological evolution.
